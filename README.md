# `nofish`

`nofish` is a Chrome extension that blocks potential spear-phishing attempts. It calculates the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) between the requested host and a list of known good hosts.

My blog post about this [project](https://leoxiong.com/nofish-using-levenshtein-distance-for-spear-phishing-detection/).
